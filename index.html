				<h1>Hello, I'm Thad</h1>

					<p>
						I'm Thaddee Caze, a bilingual French-American IB student at Fasny who's gone through three school systems. I enjoy film, rugby, scouts, kitesurfing, skiing, and am compassionate, creative, competitive, and sensitive. I lead a group of seven boys in scouts, helping them grow through high school and beyond. My goal is to make an impact by storytelling and creating inclusive job opportunities for the disabled. Cafe Joyeux, a cafe staffed mostly by disabled people, is of particular interest to me.</p>

				<h2><strong>Making movies</strong></h2>
					<p>I am passionate about making films because it allows me to translate stories from my mind into a visual medium, collaborate with skilled professionals, and tell stories that have the power to make a real difference in the world.</p>

				<h2><strong>Acting</strong></h2>
					<p>Acting allows me to immerse myself in different characters and their experiences, connect with audiences on an emotional level, and use the power of storytelling to inspire and entertain.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2><strong>Kitesurfing</strong></h2>
					<p>Kitesurfing is my passion because it offers a sense of freedom and adrenaline rush, requires a deep connection with nature, and provides an opportunity to constantly challenge and improve oneself both physically and mentally.</p>
